            "I'm delighted with these scissors. They are true left-handed scissors, with the upper blade on the left. They're well made, and a pleasure to use. I can't give them five stars, however, for two reasons. First, the sheath that comes with them is made for right-handed scissors and won't fit on these. Second, although these are true left-handed scissors, Mundial offers only a couple of its models in true left-handed versions. Worse, it also offers fake &#34;left-or-right&#34; scissors that are really right-handed scissors with modified handles. Left-handed people are 10-15% of the population, and we do every job that right-handed people do. We need every kind of scissors that right-handed people need, and we need them to be real left-handed scissors like these. When Mundial starts offering more than just a couple of popular models in true left-handed versions, and supplies them with sheathes that actually fit them, I'll come back and add stars, because these scissors really are excellent.\n",

There is a slight groove for the left-handed side, but that's really just fishing for it, in my opinion.Personally, I'm giving these to my family, who are right-handers, because they do cut well.

They keep their edge, he can cut paper and foam with them.These are useless for the left-handed child. I thought my daughter could sue these, they say they are ambidextrous on the package, but as many have said, this is an impossibility with scissors. She would cut jagged lines in everything. This lead to her getting very frustrated. You can't find left-handed scissors in any local Brick-and-mortar stores it seems. Don't buy these for your left -handers.

            "Five stars for the quality of the ink - it's smooth-flowing, very black, doesn't bleed on the paper, and dries quickly. All the qualities you want in your ink. ONE STAR for the duribility of the pens. I tend to have a very hard grasp on my pens, and these just aren't up to it. The points break far too easily. After only a month of use, the area where the pen and nib joins has weakened to the point where the pens bleed all over my fingers and are unusable. If you have a light touch, you might love these pens. If not, find a more durable instrument. I'm still looking.\n",

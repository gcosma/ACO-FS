        "This calculator determines the required sample size per group to detect differences in Poisson-distributed event rates (e.g., hospital admissions) between two groups (e.g., treatment and control). It is designed for studies comparing rates of events, such as hospital admissions, emergency visits, or other count-based outcomes, over a specified follow-up period. Users can input baseline rates, desired power, significance level, and follow-up time to estimate the sample size needed for their study."
